# Helldivers 2 Stratagem Ball

## Introduction

Welcome to the Stratagem Ball Readme! This interactive cosplay prop is inspired by the Helldivers games. It simulates the in-game Stratagem beacon with lights and a self-open/close mechanism. This readme will guide you through operation and troubleshooting.

**Please Note:**

-   This device is a fan-made replica and is not official Helldivers merchandise.
-   Read through all instructions before operation.

**Safety & Care Instructions**

-   Keep the Stratagem Ball dry and away from extreme heat.
-  The Stratagem Ball uses a motor to open and close - do not force the Ball open/close against the motor.
-   DO NOT throw the Stratagem Ball. The delicate electronics and mechanical parts may be damaged by impact.
-   Avoid charging the device for more than 24 hours at a time, as this can potentially degrade the battery life.

## **Powering the Stratagem Ball**

1.  **Remove the Magnetic Cap**  
    Gently pull off the magnetic bottom cap to access the controls.
    
2.  **Charging**
    
    -   Plug in a USB-C cable to the port labeled **USB-C**.
    -   A **red LED** next to the port will turn on while charging.
    -   The light turns off when fully charged.
        
3.  **Powering On/Off**
    
    -   Toggle the switch labeled **PWR** _toward_ the USB-C port to turn the device **on**.
    -   A **green LED** next to the switch will glow when powered.

## **Wireless Paired Mode** (_with Stratagem Tacpad_)

This mode lets the Stratagem Ball react to Stratagem entries on your Tacpad.

#### Requirements

-   Stratagem Tacpad with wireless module installed (See _insert link here_ for installation instructions)
-   Tacpad firmware **V1.2 or later**

#### Pairing Instructions

1.  Turn on the Stratagem Ball using the PWR switch.
2.  Press and hold the button labeled “PAIR” until the Ball opens and upper lights show a **spinning blue animation**
3.  On your **Tacpad**:
    -   Go to **Settings**
    -   Enable **Stratagem Ball**
    -   Press the **pairing button**
4.  After a few seconds, the Tacpad will say **“Pairing Success”**
5.  Power off and on the Stratagem Ball to complete setup.

#### Using in Paired Mode

1. Enter a Stratagem on your Tacpad.
2. The Ball will glow in the Stratagem’s color and await activation.
3. Press the **top button** on the Ball complete the activation sequence. **_DO NOT ACTUALLY THROW THE BALL._**
 4. The Ball will open and light up fully, then reset after a few seconds.

## **Standalone Mode**

Use this mode without a Tacpad—just for fun lighting and activation effects.

####  Enabling Standalone Mode

1.  Turn on the Stratagem Ball.
2.  Press and **hold the top button** until the lights momentarily **flash yellow**.

####  Using Standalone Mode

-   Press the **top button** to cycle through different Stratagem color effects:
	-   First, a “priming” light with the Ball closed
	-   Then, the Ball opens and glows brightly
-   After going through all effects, one more press resets the Ball to standby.

## **Troubleshooting**

-   **Ball won’t pair?**  
    Ensure that the Tacpad wireless module is properly installed. Power cycle both devices, then retry the pairing steps.
-   **Lights not working?**  
    Make sure the Ball is charged and the green light is on.
-   **Button unresponsive?**  
    Ensure you’re in the correct mode (Paired or Standalone). Reset the Ball if needed.
