# Helldivers 2 Stratagem Ball

## Introduction

Welcome to the Stratagem Ball Readme! This interactive cosplay prop is inspired by the Helldivers games. It simulates the in-game Stratagem beacon with lights and a self-open/close mechanism. This readme will guide you through operation and troubleshooting.

**Please Note:**

**Safety & Care Instructions**

-   Keep the Stratagem Ball dry and away from extreme heat.
-  The Stratagem Ball uses a motor to open and close - do not force the Ball open/close against the motor.
-   DO NOT throw the Stratagem Ball. The delicate electronics and mechanical parts may be damaged by impact.
